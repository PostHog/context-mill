# Commandments Configuration
# Tag-based rules that get folded into skill descriptions
# Skills collect all commandments matching their tags

commandments:
  react:
    - Never use useEffect() for analytics capture - it's brittle and causes errors
    - Prefer event handlers or routing mechanisms to trigger analytics calls
    - Add handlers where user actions occur rather than reacting to state changes

  javascript:
    - Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
    - Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
    - posthog-js is the JavaScript SDK package name

  python:
    - Remember that source code is available in the venv/site-packages directory
    - posthog is the Python SDK package name
    - Install dependencies with `pip install posthog` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` and do NOT use unquoted version specifiers like `>=` directly in shell commands
    - Use the instance-based API (Posthog(...)) instead of module-level API (posthog.api_key)
    - Use enable_exception_autocapture=True during initialization for comprehensive error tracking
    - Manual capture_exception() is for specific, handled errors only - autocapture handles unhandled exceptions
    - ALWAYS call posthog.shutdown() (NOT flush()) before script/application exit - shutdown() flushes events AND closes connections
    - Use new_context() and identify_context() for all event capture to properly associate events with users
    - Set person properties with $set/$set_once in event properties, NOT with tag() - tag() only sets event properties for the context
    - NEVER send PII (email, name, phone) in event properties unless explicitly required
    - Hash or omit sensitive data in deletion/deactivation events
    - Use user_id/distinct_id instead of email for user references

  django:
    - Add 'posthog.integrations.django.PosthogContextMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE it auto-extracts tracing headers and captures exceptions
    - Initialize PostHog in AppConfig.ready() with api_key and host from environment variables
    - Use the context API pattern with new_context(), identify_context(user_id), then capture()
    - For login/logout views, create a new context since user state changes during the request
    - Do NOT create custom middleware, distinct_id helpers, or conditional checks - the SDK handles these

  flask:
    - Initialize PostHog globally in create_app() using posthog.api_key and posthog.host (NOT per-request)
    - Manually capture exceptions with `posthog.capture_exception(e)` for error tracking since Flask has built-in error handlers
    - Blueprint registration happens AFTER PostHog initialization in create_app()

  php:
    - Remember that source code is available in the vendor directory after composer install
    - posthog/posthog-php is the PHP SDK package name
    - Check composer.json for existing dependencies and autoload configuration before adding new files
    - The PHP SDK uses static methods (PostHog::capture, PostHog::identify) - initialize once with PostHog::init()
    - PHP SDK methods take associative arrays with 'distinctId', 'event', 'properties' keys - not positional arguments

  tanstack-router:
    - Use TanStack Router's built-in navigation events for pageview tracking instead of useEffect
    - Use PostHogProvider in the root route (__root.tsx) so all child routes have access to the PostHog context

  tanstack-start:
    - Use PostHogProvider in the root route (__root.tsx) for client-side tracking
    - Use posthog-node for server-side event capture in API routes (src/routes/api/) - do NOT use posthog-js on the server
    - Create a singleton PostHog server client to avoid re-initialization on every request

  laravel:
    - Create a dedicated PostHogService class in app/Services/ - do NOT scatter PostHog::capture calls throughout controllers
    - Register PostHog configuration in config/posthog.php using env() for all settings (api_key, host, disabled)
    - Do NOT use Laravel's event system or observers for analytics - call capture explicitly where actions occur
