# Commandments Configuration
# Tag-based rules that get folded into skill descriptions
# Skills collect all commandments matching their tags

commandments:
  react:
    - Never use useEffect() for analytics capture - it's brittle and causes errors
    - Prefer event handlers or routing mechanisms to trigger analytics calls
    - Add handlers where user actions occur rather than reacting to state changes

  javascript:
    - Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
    - Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
    - posthog-js is the JavaScript SDK package name

  python:
    - Remember that source code is available in the venv/site-packages directory
    - posthog is the Python SDK package name

  django:
    - Add 'posthog.integrations.django.PosthogContextMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE it auto-extracts tracing headers and captures exceptions
    - Initialize PostHog in AppConfig.ready() with api_key and host from environment variables
    - Use the context API pattern with new_context(), identify_context(user_id), then capture()
    - For login/logout views, create a new context since user state changes during the request
    - Do NOT create custom middleware, distinct_id helpers, or conditional checks - the SDK handles these

  php:
    - Remember that source code is available in the vendor directory after composer install
    - posthog/posthog-php is the PHP SDK package name
    - Check composer.json for existing dependencies and autoload configuration before adding new files
    - The PHP SDK uses static methods (PostHog::capture, PostHog::identify) - initialize once with PostHog::init()
    - PHP SDK methods take associative arrays with 'distinctId', 'event', 'properties' keys - not positional arguments

  laravel:
    - Create a dedicated PostHogService class in app/Services/ - do NOT scatter PostHog::capture calls throughout controllers
    - Register PostHog configuration in config/posthog.php using env() for all settings (api_key, host, disabled)
    - Do NOT use Laravel's event system or observers for analytics - call capture explicitly where actions occur
