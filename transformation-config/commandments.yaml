# Commandments Configuration
# Tag-based rules that get folded into skill descriptions
# Skills collect all commandments matching their tags

commandments:
  react:
    - Never use useEffect() for analytics capture - it's brittle and causes errors
    - Prefer event handlers or routing mechanisms to trigger analytics calls
    - Add handlers where user actions occur rather than reacting to state changes

  javascript:
    - Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
    - Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
    - posthog-js is the JavaScript SDK package name

  python:
    - Remember that source code is available in the venv/site-packages directory
    - posthog is the Python SDK package name
    - Install dependencies with `pip install posthog` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` and do NOT use unquoted version specifiers like `>=` directly in shell commands
    - In CLIs and scripts: MUST call posthog.shutdown() before exit or all events are lost

  django:
    - Add 'posthog.integrations.django.PosthogContextMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE it auto-extracts tracing headers and captures exceptions
    - Initialize PostHog in AppConfig.ready() with api_key and host from environment variables
    - Use the context API pattern with new_context(), identify_context(user_id), then capture()
    - For login/logout views, create a new context since user state changes during the request
    - Do NOT create custom middleware, distinct_id helpers, or conditional checks - the SDK handles these

  flask:
    - Initialize PostHog globally in create_app() using posthog.api_key and posthog.host (NOT per-request)
    - Manually capture exceptions with `posthog.capture_exception(e)` for error tracking since Flask has built-in error handlers
    - Blueprint registration happens AFTER PostHog initialization in create_app()

  fastapi:
    - Initialize PostHog in the lifespan context manager on startup using posthog.api_key and posthog.host
    - Call posthog.flush() in the lifespan shutdown to ensure all events are sent before the app exits
    - Use Pydantic Settings with @lru_cache decorator on get_settings() for caching and easy test overrides
    - Use FastAPI dependency injection (Depends) for accessing current_user and settings in route handlers
    - Use the same context API pattern as Flask/Django (with new_context(), identify_context(user_id), then capture())

  php:
    - Remember that source code is available in the vendor directory after composer install
    - posthog/posthog-php is the PHP SDK package name
    - Check composer.json for existing dependencies and autoload configuration before adding new files
    - The PHP SDK uses static methods (PostHog::capture, PostHog::identify) - initialize once with PostHog::init()
    - PHP SDK methods take associative arrays with 'distinctId', 'event', 'properties' keys - not positional arguments

  tanstack-router:
    - Use TanStack Router's built-in navigation events for pageview tracking instead of useEffect
    - Use PostHogProvider in the root component defined in either the file-based convention (__root.tsx) or code-based convention (wherever createRootRoute() is called) so all child routes have access to the PostHog client

  tanstack-start:
    - Use PostHogProvider in the root route (__root.tsx) for client-side tracking
    - Use posthog-node for server-side event capture in API routes (src/routes/api/) - do NOT use posthog-js on the server
    - Create a singleton PostHog server client to avoid re-initialization on every request

  laravel:
    - Create a dedicated PostHogService class in app/Services/ - do NOT scatter PostHog::capture calls throughout controllers
    - Register PostHog configuration in config/posthog.php using env() for all settings (api_key, host, disabled)
    - Do NOT use Laravel's event system or observers for analytics - call capture explicitly where actions occur

  sveltekit:
    - Set paths.relative to false in svelte.config.js — this is required for PostHog session replay to work correctly with SSR and is easy to miss
    - Use the Svelte MCP server tools to check Svelte documentation (list-sections, get-documentation) and validate components (svelte-autofixer) — always run svelte-autofixer on new or modified .svelte files before finishing

  swift:
    - Read configuration from environment variables via a `PostHogEnv` enum with a `value` computed property that calls `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment[rawValue]` and `fatalError`s if missing — cases should be `apiKey = "POSTHOG_API_KEY"` and `host = "POSTHOG_HOST"`, set in the Xcode scheme's Run environment variables
    - When adding SPM dependencies to project.pbxproj, create three distinct objects with unique UUIDs — a `PBXBuildFile` (with `productRef`), an `XCSwiftPackageProductDependency` (with `package` and `productName`), and an `XCRemoteSwiftPackageReference` (with `repositoryURL` and `requirement`). The build file goes in the Frameworks phase `files`, the product dependency goes in the target's `packageProductDependencies`, and the package reference goes in the project's `packageReferences`.
    - Check the latest release version of posthog-ios at `https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-ios/releases` before setting the `minimumVersion` in the SPM package reference — do not hardcode a stale version
    - If the project uses App Sandbox (macOS), add `ENABLE_OUTGOING_NETWORK_CONNECTIONS = YES` to the target's build settings so PostHog can reach its servers — do NOT disable the sandbox entirely
  
  react-native:
    - posthog-react-native is the React Native SDK package name
    - Use react-native-config to load POSTHOG_API_KEY and POSTHOG_HOST from .env (variables are embedded at build time, not runtime)
    - Place PostHogProvider INSIDE NavigationContainer for React Navigation v7 compatibility
    
  expo:
    - posthog-react-native is the React Native SDK package name (same as bare RN)
    - Use expo-constants with app.config.js extras for POSTHOG_API_KEY and POSTHOG_HOST (NOT react-native-config)
    - Access config via `Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.posthogApiKey` in your posthog.ts config file
    - For expo-router, wrap PostHogProvider in app/_layout.tsx and manually track screens with `posthog.screen(pathname, params)` in a useEffect

  astro:
    - Always use the is:inline directive on PostHog script tags to prevent Astro from processing them and causing TypeScript errors
    - Use PUBLIC_ prefix for client-side environment variables in Astro (e.g., PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY)
    - Create a posthog.astro component in src/components/ for reusable initialization across pages
    - Import the PostHog component in a Layout and wrap all pages with that layout

  astro-view-transitions:
    - Wrap PostHog initialization with a window.__posthog_initialized guard to prevent stack overflow during soft navigation
    - Set capture_pageview option to 'history_change' for automatic pageview tracking during soft navigation
    - Use the astro page-load event instead of just DOMContentLoaded to re-run scripts after soft navigation

  astro-ssr:
    - Use posthog-node in API routes under src/pages/api/ for server-side event tracking
    - Store the posthog-node client instance in a singleton pattern (src/lib/posthog-server.ts) to avoid creating multiple clients
    - Pass the client session ID to server via X-PostHog-Session-Id header for unified session tracking

  astro-hybrid:
    - Use posthog-node in API routes under src/pages/api/ for server-side event tracking
    - Store the posthog-node client instance in a singleton pattern (src/lib/posthog-server.ts) to avoid creating multiple clients
    - In Astro 5, use output static (the default) with an adapter - pages are prerendered by default
    - Use export const prerender = false to opt specific pages into SSR when they need server-side rendering
    - Only pages that need server-side PostHog tracking (like API-backed forms) should opt out of prerendering
  
  angular:
    - Use inject() instead of constructor injection. PostHog service should be injected via inject() in components/services that need it.
    - Create a dedicated PosthogService as a singleton root service that wraps the PostHog SDK.
    - Always use standalone components over NgModules.
    - Configure PostHog credentials in src/environments/environment.ts files, as Angular reads environment variables from these configuration files

  android:
    - Adapt dependency configuration to the appropriate build.gradle(.kts) file according to the project gradle version
    - Call `PostHogAndroid.setup()` only once in the Application class's `onCreate()` method, so it's initialized as early as possible and only once.
    - Initialize PostHog in the Application class's `onCreate()` method
    - Ensure every activity has a `android:label` to accurately track screen views.
