# Commandments Configuration
# Tag-based rules that get folded into skill descriptions
# Skills collect all commandments matching their tags

commandments:
  react:
    - Never use useEffect() for analytics capture - it's brittle and causes errors
    - Prefer event handlers or routing mechanisms to trigger analytics calls
    - Add handlers where user actions occur rather than reacting to state changes

  javascript:
    - Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
    - Check package.json for type checking or build scripts to validate changes
    - posthog-js is the JavaScript SDK package name

  python:
    - Remember that source code is available in the venv/site-packages directory
    - posthog is the Python SDK package name
    - Install dependencies with `pip install posthog` or `pip install -r requirements.txt` and do NOT use unquoted version specifiers like `>=` directly in shell commands

  django:
    - Add 'posthog.integrations.django.PosthogContextMiddleware' to MIDDLEWARE it auto-extracts tracing headers and captures exceptions
    - Initialize PostHog in AppConfig.ready() with api_key and host from environment variables
    - Use the context API pattern with new_context(), identify_context(user_id), then capture()
    - For login/logout views, create a new context since user state changes during the request
    - Do NOT create custom middleware, distinct_id helpers, or conditional checks - the SDK handles these

  flask:
    - Initialize PostHog globally in create_app() using posthog.api_key and posthog.host (NOT per-request)
    - Manually capture exceptions with `posthog.capture_exception(e)` for error tracking since Flask has built-in error handlers
    - Blueprint registration happens AFTER PostHog initialization in create_app()

  php:
    - Remember that source code is available in the vendor directory after composer install
    - posthog/posthog-php is the PHP SDK package name
    - Check composer.json for existing dependencies and autoload configuration before adding new files
    - The PHP SDK uses static methods (PostHog::capture, PostHog::identify) - initialize once with PostHog::init()
    - PHP SDK methods take associative arrays with 'distinctId', 'event', 'properties' keys - not positional arguments

  laravel:
    - Create a dedicated PostHogService class in app/Services/ - do NOT scatter PostHog::capture calls throughout controllers
    - Register PostHog configuration in config/posthog.php using env() for all settings (api_key, host, disabled)
    - Do NOT use Laravel's event system or observers for analytics - call capture explicitly where actions occur

  llm-analytics:
    - Use environment variables for ALL API keys and PostHog credentials, never hardcode them
    - PostHog AI wrappers do NOT proxy LLM calls — they only send analytics events asynchronously
    - Always pass posthog_distinct_id (Python) or posthogDistinctId (Node) to associate events with users
    - Use posthog_trace_id / posthogTraceId to group related LLM calls into a single trace

  node:
    - Import AI wrappers from '@posthog/ai', not from provider SDKs directly
    - Always call phClient.shutdown() before process exit to flush pending events
    - Use 'posthog-node' for the PostHog client, '@posthog/ai' for LLM wrappers

  openai-compatible:
    - Use PostHog's OpenAI wrapper with a custom base_url/baseURL — the provider's own SDK is not needed
    - Model names are provider-specific — check the provider's docs for available models

  ai-framework:
    - For callback-based frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, LangGraph), pass the callback handler in the config
    - For client-injection frameworks (Instructor, LlamaIndex, Pydantic AI), create a PostHog OpenAI wrapper first

  ai-gateway:
    - Gateway integrations use the OpenAI wrapper with a custom base_url pointing to the gateway
    - Additional headers may be required (e.g., Portkey needs x-portkey-api-key and x-portkey-virtual-key)
