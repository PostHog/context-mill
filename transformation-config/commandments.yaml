# Commandments Configuration
# Tag-based rules that get folded into skill descriptions
# Skills collect all commandments matching their tags

commandments:
  react:
    - Never use useEffect() for analytics capture - it's brittle and causes errors
    - Prefer event handlers or routing mechanisms to trigger analytics calls
    - Add handlers where user actions occur rather than reacting to state changes

  javascript:
    - Remember that source code is available in the node_modules directory
