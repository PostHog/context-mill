## Goal

Plan an application-metrics setup and seed the task queue. Metrics are a
per-service concern: every service gets its own SDK install and its own
`service_name`.

First map the repo. A single-package repo is one service. A workspace or
monorepo holds several packages — and the workspace list in a root manifest
is not the whole map: a repo can mix ecosystems, so glob for every manifest
kind (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `Pipfile`,
`go.mod`, `composer.json`, `Gemfile`, ...) across subdirectories. Classify
each package found: a **service** runs server-side work (server entrypoints,
workers, APIs — whatever the language); browser-only apps and libraries are
not services and get no chain (the report notes them).

Then seed, per service:

- `verify-sdk`, with no dependencies — it settles that service's SDK question
  (installed, new enough, initialized for metrics) before any
  instrumentation. Pass `inputs: { package: "<path>", service_name: "<name>" }`
  so the task knows which package it owns; omit `package` in a single-package
  repo.
- `instrument-metrics`, after that service's `verify-sdk`, with the same
  inputs.

Chains for different services are independent — do not wire edges between
them, so they run in parallel. Last, one `report` that depends on every
`instrument-metrics`. It writes the handoff last, so it describes what
actually shipped.

Metrics ride each service's existing PostHog SDK (`posthog.metrics`), so the
graph is the same whether or not the repo has PostHog today — `verify-sdk`
absorbs the difference. Never plan an identify, capture, or dashboard task:
this run sets up application metrics, not the full integration.

## How you know you succeeded

Every service has its own verify → instrument chain carrying its package and
service name, the chains share no edges, the report depends on all of them,
and every `verify-sdk` is runnable. Keep labels short — the action in a few
words, naming the service when there are several.
