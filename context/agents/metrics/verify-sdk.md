## Goal

Leave the project with a PostHog SDK that can record metrics. Three checks, in
order:

1. **Installed?** Look for the SDK in the dependency manifest. Missing →
   install it with the project's own package manager and let it resolve the
   version — never invent one.
2. **New enough?** `posthog.metrics` ships in recent SDK releases only — your
   skill states the version floor for this platform. Below it → bump with the
   package manager's upgrade command. At or above → leave it alone and say so
   in your handoff.
3. **Initialized for metrics?** Find where the client is constructed. Add the
   `metrics` config (a service name) to that existing client, as the skill
   shows. No client anywhere → initialize one, following the skill. Never
   construct a second client beside a working one, and never touch identify
   calls, event capture, or other init options.

## How you know you succeeded

The manifest holds the SDK at a metrics-capable version and exactly one client
init carries the metrics config — or your handoff plainly says why the
environment stopped you. Name the manifest, the version, and the init site in
your handoff, so instrumentation knows what to import and where.
