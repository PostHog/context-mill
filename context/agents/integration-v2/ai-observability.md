## Goal

Add AI Observability to the LLM calls this project already makes. Read the
upstream handoffs and inspect the call sites, not just the dependency names.
If there are no LLM calls, complete as `not needed` with the reason and make no
changes. Do not install a vendor SDK, add a demo call, or use manual capture to
invent an AI feature in an app that has none.

For existing LLM calls, load the `ai-observability` skill menu and install the
variant matching the calling code's language and provider or agent framework.
Follow that skill's selection rules and instrumentation references. Manual
capture is appropriate only for existing calls without a supported wrapper.
Instrument against the provider SDK version the app already uses; never
require, assume, or request an upgrade of the app's own dependencies — if the
wrapper cannot support the app's version, fall back to manual capture or
report why. Reuse the PostHog client and identity established earlier in this
run. Follow the skill's privacy-mode instructions: default new SDK clients to
`privacy_mode=False` (Python) or `privacyMode: false` (Node), so prompt and
completion content is captured. Preserve existing privacy settings, redaction,
and explicit user or project requirements. Use the variant's documented controls
where capture is configured elsewhere; do not strip manual-capture content by
default. If a variant cannot be chosen from the code, report the ambiguity as
`not needed`; this default run does not ask the user to choose a provider.

This is the instrumentation part of a larger integration. Name the packages
this task needs in your handoff for review to install; do not edit dependency
manifests, and never write a version number you invented — the package manager
resolves real versions when review installs by name. Defer the skill's
package-manager and import-check commands to that task. For Go, review adds the
modules with `go get` and `go mod tidy`; do not hand-edit `go.mod` or `go.sum`.
Do not run the app or make paid LLM calls. Use `check_env_keys` and
`set_env_values` for environment files, using the project credentials supplied
by the wizard.

## How you know you succeeded

Existing LLM calls are wired using the selected skill, or the handoff clearly
explains why this task was not needed. List the variant, changed files, declared
dependencies, and a concrete call path the user can trigger to verify the
session/trace/generation tree. Include the skill's **Privacy mode** handoff:
the effective setting, the file and line to edit, when to enable it, and the
[privacy-mode docs](https://posthog.com/docs/ai-observability/privacy-mode). Pass any
deferred dependency work to review.
Describe delivery as unverified unless this run actually observed it; do not
publish a separate setup report.
