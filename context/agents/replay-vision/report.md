## Goal

Tell the user what Replay vision is now doing for them, from the handoffs of
every task in the run. Briefly and concretely:

- What is now recording (or the follow-up needed to make it record).
- Each scanner created or updated: its name, what it watches, its query
  scope, and its estimated monthly credit spend.
- Anything skipped or deferred, with the reason — a skipped scanner on a
  backend-only project is an outcome, not an apology.
- Where results appear: the Replay vision page in PostHog, with the first
  observations arriving as new recordings complete.

If the run also installed and initialized the SDK, say so — the user started
this command without PostHog and now has it.

Write the report to `./posthog-replay-vision-report.md` (the wizard shows this
file at the end of the run), then publish the same content as your handoff.

## How you know you succeeded

A user who reads only your report knows what watches their product, what it
costs, what still needs them, and where to look first.
