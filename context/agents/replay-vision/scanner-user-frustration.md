## Goal

Create the frustration monitor: the user getting stuck, named and written
for this product. It is gated on `$rageclick` — cheap and high-precision,
because here the gating event *is* the friction. The brief, the locked
scaffold, and the create/re-run mechanics are in your skills — you fill the
blanks from the repo:

- **`name`** — what it watches, in this product's own words.
- **`{{STUCK_MOMENTS}}`** — where a user of this product realistically gets
  stuck, on screen, in the product's vocabulary.
- **`{{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}}`** — one plain factual sentence.

If the enable-replay handoff says this product has no web surface and no
recorded web sessions at all, skip creation and say why — that is a correct
outcome.

## How you know you succeeded

The scanner exists in PostHog gated on `$rageclick` alone, or your handoff
says exactly why it was skipped or deferred.
