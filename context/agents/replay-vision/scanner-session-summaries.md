## Goal

Create the summary scanner: a rolling sample of plain-language session
summaries in this product's own vocabulary, so the user sees the breadth of
what scanners produce. The brief, the locked scaffold, and the create/re-run
mechanics are in your skills — you fill the blanks from the repo:

- **`name`** — in this product's own words.
- **`{{VOCABULARY}}`** — the nouns and verbs this product's UI uses for its
  key flows, so summaries read like the product.
- **`{{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}}`** — one plain factual sentence.

It samples every recording with no query scope, kept cheap by a low sampling
rate — **never raise the sampling rate during setup**.

If the enable-replay handoff says this product has no web surface and no
recorded web sessions at all, skip creation and say why — that is a correct
outcome.

## How you know you succeeded

The scanner exists in PostHog at the brief's sampling rate, or your
handoff says exactly why it was skipped or deferred.
