## Goal

Put the PostHog source-map upload credentials into this project's environment.
Install the skill your task input names (`install_skill` with the `skillId`)
and follow its **"Write credentials to the env file"** step for the variable
names and the env file to pick.

The upload needs a PostHog **personal API key** at build time. Only the user can
mint one — never call the PostHog API or any tool to create it. Get it and
write it in this one task (the key never survives across tasks):

1. Ask with `wizard_ask`, exactly:
   `{ id: "api-key", prompt: "Paste your PostHog personal API key below.\n\nDon't have one yet? Create one here:\n<SETTINGS_URL>\n\nWhen creating the key, choose the 'Source map upload' preset, then come back and paste it here.", kind: "text", sensitive: true }`
   You receive `{ secretRef: "secret:..." }` — a vaulted reference, never the raw
   value. If `wizard_ask` is unavailable (non-interactive run), report this task
   with status `not needed` and say in your handoff that the user must create
   the key and set the variables themselves; do not block.
2. Pick the env file per the skill (reuse the one PostHog's SDK already writes
   its `POSTHOG_*` vars to, when there is one). Call `check_env_keys` on it
   first (it returns present/absent, never values — never read the file
   directly).
3. Settle the variable names before you write them — see "The names are a
   contract" below. Then call `set_env_values`, passing the secretRef as a
   value object, not a literal string — e.g.
   `values: { "POSTHOG_CLI_API_KEY": { secretRef: "<the ref>" }, "POSTHOG_CLI_PROJECT_ID": "<PROJECT_ID>", "POSTHOG_CLI_HOST": "<UI_HOST>" }`
   with whichever names you settled on. The wizard resolves the ref locally, so
   you never see the key value.
4. Document the same variable names for other developers: append them to
   `.env.example` (create it if the project has none) with empty or
   placeholder values — never a real value, and never the key itself. The
   example file is committed and is the only `.env*` you may write directly;
   it is how the next developer, and the next wizard run's `check_env_keys`,
   learns the project expects these variables.

Replace `<SETTINGS_URL>`, `<PROJECT_ID>`, and `<UI_HOST>` from your project
context. Do not touch the build config — the `configure` task owns that.

## The names are a contract

An env variable only works if the name in the file is the name the code reads.
You write the file; the `configure` task writes the code that reads it, and you
two run in parallel. So never invent a name that already exists somewhere else
— look for the other half of the contract first, and adopt it:

- **Read the build config before you choose.** If it already references PostHog
  env variables, use exactly those names, whatever they are, even when they are
  not the ones your skill would suggest. Reading config is safe — it holds
  names, not secrets.
- **Only when nothing references them yet** are you the one deciding. Use the
  names your skill documents for the mechanism that was actually wired.
- **Either way, say which set you chose in your handoff, in full.** That is how
  `configure` and `wire-ci` learn what to match. A handoff that says "the usual
  variables" hands the next task the same guess you just made.

Names that merely look plausible are the failure here. A build reading
`POSTHOG_API_KEY` beside an env file holding `POSTHOG_CLI_API_KEY` throws no
error anywhere — the upload simply never runs, and every stack trace stays
minified.

## How you know you succeeded

The env file holds the upload variables (the key as a resolved secret, the
non-secret project id and host as literals), written through the wizard tools,
never hardcoded in source, and `.env.example` documents the same names with
placeholders. Your handoff names the env file and every variable name — never
a value — so the CI task carries the same names into the pipeline.
