# Mirror the report into a PostHog notebook

Mirror the setup report into a shareable PostHog notebook, so the user has an
in-app copy to link and comment on.
The `publish_handoff` call and the notebook are how the report reaches the user.

The notebook is best effort. The report already reached the user through
`publish_handoff`, so a notebook that can't be created never fails your task.
Say in your task's own handoff (your final message, not a second
`publish_handoff` call) that it wasn't created and why, then finish.

## `publish_handoff` creates it

Your one `publish_handoff` call creates the notebook from the same markdown.
You don't pass anything extra. Its result tells you what happened:

- **The result says the notebook was created or updated.** The mirror is done. Don't create
  another notebook, and don't emit the `[NOTEBOOK_URL]` marker. The wizard
  already shows the link.
- **The result says the notebook was not created.** The wizard already
  retried once, so the reason is final. Don't retry through `posthog_exec`.
  Put the reason in your task's own handoff.
- **The result says the notebook was not updated.** The notebook exists and
  holds the earlier report, and the wizard already shows its link. Don't
  create another notebook. Say in your task's own handoff that the notebook
  holds the earlier version, and why.
- **The result doesn't mention a notebook.** This wizard predates the
  built-in notebook. Mirror the report yourself, as below.

## Mirror it yourself on older wizards

Which notebook tool the PostHog MCP offers depends on a feature flag, so check
the catalog once:

```
search notebooks-create
```

Then use the tool the catalog lists, with the exact report markdown you passed
to `publish_handoff`, verbatim:

- **`notebooks-create-markdown` is listed.** Create the notebook with it,
  passing a `title` and the report as `markdown`. The title becomes the
  notebook's leading `# heading`, so start the `markdown` at the first section
  below it.
- **Only `notebooks-create` is listed.** Create the notebook with it, passing
  a `title` and the whole report, H1 included, inside one markdown notebook
  node as `content`. Don't translate the report into other rich-text nodes.
  This path has no `notebooks-add-cell`.
- **Neither is listed.** Skip the notebook.

The exec command is `call <tool>` followed by the bare JSON argument, with no
quotes around it. The whole argument goes on one line, with the report's
newlines and quotes escaped as normal JSON string encoding (`\n`, `\"`, `\\`):

```
call notebooks-create-markdown {"title": "PostHog setup (wizard) – acme-shop", "markdown": "## Events captured\n\n| Event | Where |\n|---|---|\n| `user_signed_up` | `src/auth.ts` |\n\nInitialized with \"capture_exceptions: true\"\n"}
call notebooks-create {"title": "PostHog setup (wizard) – acme-shop", "content": {"type": "doc", "content": [{"type": "ph-markdown-notebook", "attrs": {"nodeId": "markdown-notebook-v2", "markdown": "# PostHog setup (wizard) – acme-shop\n\n## Events captured\n\n| Event | Where |\n|---|---|\n| `user_signed_up` | `src/auth.ts` |\n\nInitialized with \"capture_exceptions: true\"\n"}}]}}
```

Wrong, and their exact errors:

```
call notebooks-create-markdown '{"title": ...}'   → "Unexpected token" (quotes reach the JSON parser)
call notebooks-create-markdown {"...": "line one
line two"}                                        → "Bad control character" (literal newline in a JSON string)
```

A full multi-page report goes through in one call when encoded this way. Never
trim the report just to make it parse. If a correctly encoded
`notebooks-create-markdown` payload still fails, split the transport: create
the notebook with the first sections, then append each remaining section as a
markdown cell with `notebooks-add-cell`, passing the `notebook_id` from the
create response:

```
call notebooks-add-cell {"notebook_id": "AbCdEfGh", "cell_type": "markdown", "markdown": "## Next steps\n\n- Replace the `DISTINCT_ID` placeholder in `src/auth.ts`\n"}
```

The create response carries the notebook's `short_id` and its URL. Build the
link as `<posthog host>/project/<project id>/notebooks/<short_id>` and print it
in your final message as one plain line, marker first, so the wizard can show
it on the end screen. A markdown link is not picked up:

```
[NOTEBOOK_URL] https://us.posthog.com/project/12345/notebooks/AbCdEfGh
```
