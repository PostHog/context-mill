title: PostHog Setup - Conclusion
description: Review and fix any errors in the PostHog integration implementation

Use the PostHog MCP to create a new dashboard named "Analytics basics" based on the events created here. Populate it with up to five insights, with special emphasis on things like conversion funnels, churn events, and other business critical insights.

Create the file posthog-setup-report.md. It should include a summary of the integration edits, a table with the event names, event descriptions, and files where events were added, along with a list of links for the dashboard and insights created. Follow this format:

<wizard-report>
